# New Repository Template

This is the homepage for the Jekyll site that will be associated with the new repository.  Use it to write user documentation, technical specifications, and whatnot.

Note that when editing the site, all the files will end in `.md` but can be linked to as `.html`.  For example, to edit this page, edit `index.md`.  To link to it, use `index.html`.
